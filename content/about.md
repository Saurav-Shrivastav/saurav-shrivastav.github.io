Hi! I'm **Saurav Shrivastav**, a final-year Computer Engineering student who is passionate about building and designing software. When I'm not working, I enjoy indulging in my favorite leisure activities such as watching football, playing FIFA, traveling, and listening to Daft Punk. I also love to read books and watch sci-fi movies, including Star Wars, Star Trek, Mr. Robot, Dune and many more.

I am always driven to learn new technologies and techniques that help me build scalable and efficient solutions to complex problems. I believe in striking a balance between work and life and believe in enjoying the journey, rather than just focusing on the destination. My long-term goal is to work in a tech hub like Silicon Valley or settle in a calm European town, where I can continue to build world-class software.

My approach to learning is practical and experience-based, rather than just grinding away at Leetcode problems. This has given me real-world experience and the confidence to tackle any challenge that comes my way.

Currently, I am working as a Backend Engineering Intern at [Walldotapp](https://wall.app), where I am contributing to the development of a Web3 questing platform. This platform leverages on-chain data to create intelligent personas for other Web3 projects, allowing them to target their campaigns more effectively and increase their reach. My role involves working on the backend and DevOps, and I am always eager to take on new challenges. You can find more information about my skills and previous endeavors on my experiences page.

This brief overview should give you a good idea of who I am and what I stand for. If you're interested in learning more, feel free to explore my portfolio further.
