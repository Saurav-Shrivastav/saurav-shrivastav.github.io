## Summary

GFS is a scalable distributed file system for large distributed data-intensive applications. It provides fault tolerance while running on inexpensive commodity hardware, and delivers high aggregate performance to a large number of clients.

## Key Insights

- **Component failures are the norm**: Design assumes constant hardware failures
- **Huge files by traditional standards**: Optimized for multi-GB files
- **Append-heavy workloads**: Most files are mutated by appending new data
- **Co-designing applications and file system**: Applications and file system API evolved together

## My Notes

This paper was groundbreaking because it showed how to build a reliable distributed file system using commodity hardware. Key design decisions that made this work:

1. **Single master design**: Simplified consistency but required careful management to avoid bottlenecks
2. **Large chunk size (64 MB)**: Reduced metadata overhead and network requests
3. **Weak consistency model**: Relaxed consistency for better performance and availability

The paper is particularly interesting because it influenced so many later systems - HDFS, for example, is heavily inspired by GFS.

## Why This Paper Matters

This paper essentially defined how modern distributed file systems work. It showed that you could build reliable systems from unreliable components at massive scale.
