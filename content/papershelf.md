A curated collection of research papers, articles, and books that have influenced my thinking and work. This is my digital bookshelf where I share resources that I find valuable and worth revisiting.

## Featured Papers & Books

For detailed reviews and my personal notes on papers, visit my [Papers section](/papers/) where I share in-depth analysis and insights.

## Reading Philosophy

I believe in:
- **Deep reading**: Taking detailed notes and reflecting on key insights
- **Connecting ideas**: Finding relationships between different papers and concepts
- **Practical application**: Understanding how research applies to real-world problems
- **Sharing knowledge**: Making research accessible through clear explanations

## Current Areas of Interest

- **Distributed Systems**: Consensus algorithms, consistency models, fault tolerance
- **Database Systems**: Storage engines, query optimization, transaction processing
- **System Design**: Scalability patterns, performance optimization, reliability
- **Software Engineering**: Code quality, testing strategies, development practices
