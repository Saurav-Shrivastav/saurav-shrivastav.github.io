<!-- # Hi, I'm <span class="highlight-name">Saurav Shrivastav</span>

**Software Engineer** at LinkedIn, working on Hadoop Infrastructure in Bangalore, India

I'm passionate about building scalable distributed systems and love exploring new technologies. Through this space, I share my journey of learning, experimenting, and contributing to the world of software engineering.

Read more about me at [about](/about/) or check out my latest posts in the [blog](/blog/).

<!-- ## What I Do

Currently, I work on Hadoop infrastructure at LinkedIn, where I focus on:
- **Large-Scale Infrastructure**: Built automated cluster expansion systems and worker host health validation using Temporal workflows
- **Distributed Data Systems**: Developed a comprehensive inventory manager handling millions of records, tracking host state transitions across Hadoop clusters and production environments
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Designed systems using Kafka and pub-sub patterns for real-time data publishing from multiple sources
- **Site Reliability**: Ensuring robust, performant infrastructure for massive data workloads at LinkedIn scale

I'm a curious engineer who enjoys exploring all technologies - from databases and distributed systems to emerging tools and frameworks.

## My Journey

- **Open Source Contributor**: Participated in Google Summer of Code and actively contribute to projects like PostgreSQL and OpenWISP
- **Scale Engineer**: Experience building systems that handle millions of records and complex state management
- **Technology Explorer**: Always learning new technologies and sharing insights through research and experimentation
- **Knowledge Sharer**: Passionate about documenting learnings and helping others grow in their technical journey

## My Learning Philosophy

I believe in learning through building. Every system I work on teaches me something new, and every research paper I read opens up new possibilities. I'm convinced that the best way to understand complex distributed systems is to get your hands dirty with real-world problems at scale, while staying grounded in solid computer science fundamentals.

**Software Engineer | Distributed Systems & Infrastructure Orchestration**

I engineer the software that powers large-scale infrastructure. Currently, I am a Software Engineer at **LinkedIn** in the Reliability Infra organization, where I build distributed orchestration engines to manage a fleet of **80,000+ nodes**. My work focuses on transforming complex operational challenges into scalable, “Infra-as-Code” solutions using **Python, Go, and Temporal**.

## What I’m Building

Currently, I focus on Hadoop/YARN/HDFS infrastructure at scale, with a growing focus on agentic automation:

* **Distributed Orchestration**: Designed and implemented state-machine driven remediation workflows using **Temporal** to manage host lifecycles across multi-datacenter deployments.
* **Infrastructure-as-Code**: Automated cluster expansion and host provisioning systems for a massive Hadoop fleet, recovering significant underutilized hardware capacity.
* **Resource Management**: Built heuristic-based allocation engines to proactively manage build pool hosts, reducing idle time by **88%**.
* **Platform Modernization**: Leading core service upgrades to modern API frameworks to improve data correctness and system resilience.

## The Current Sprint: AI & Systems

I believe the next frontier of infrastructure is **Autonomous Reliability**. I am currently documenting my journey in building:
* **Agentic Workflows**: Orchestrating LLMs via **LangGraph** to reason about and fix complex system faults.
* **Reliable AI**: Integrating Agentic loops with **Temporal** to ensure AI-driven remediations are consistent, durable, and safe for production.
* **System Internals**: Deep-diving into **Consensus Protocols (Raft/Paxos)** and high-performance networking with **gRPC**.
