# Hi, I'm <span class="highlight-name">Saurav Shrivastav</span>

**Software Engineer** at LinkedIn, working on Hadoop Infrastructure in Bangalore, India

I'm passionate about building scalable distributed systems and love exploring new technologies. Through this space, I share my journey of learning, experimenting, and contributing to the world of software engineering.

Read more about me at [about](/about/) or check out my latest posts in the [blog](/blog/).

<!-- ## What I Do

Currently, I work on Hadoop infrastructure at LinkedIn, where I focus on:
- **Large-Scale Infrastructure**: Built automated cluster expansion systems and worker host health validation using Temporal workflows
- **Distributed Data Systems**: Developed a comprehensive inventory manager handling millions of records, tracking host state transitions across Hadoop clusters and production environments
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Designed systems using Kafka and pub-sub patterns for real-time data publishing from multiple sources
- **Site Reliability**: Ensuring robust, performant infrastructure for massive data workloads at LinkedIn scale

I'm a curious engineer who enjoys exploring all technologies - from databases and distributed systems to emerging tools and frameworks.

## My Journey

- **Open Source Contributor**: Participated in Google Summer of Code and actively contribute to projects like PostgreSQL and OpenWISP
- **Scale Engineer**: Experience building systems that handle millions of records and complex state management
- **Technology Explorer**: Always learning new technologies and sharing insights through research and experimentation
- **Knowledge Sharer**: Passionate about documenting learnings and helping others grow in their technical journey

## My Learning Philosophy

I believe in learning through building. Every system I work on teaches me something new, and every research paper I read opens up new possibilities. I'm convinced that the best way to understand complex distributed systems is to get your hands dirty with real-world problems at scale, while staying grounded in solid computer science fundamentals. -->
