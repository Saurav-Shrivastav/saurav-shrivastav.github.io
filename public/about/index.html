## My Journey

My journey into software engineering began at Thapar Institute of Engineering & Technology, where I discovered my passion for building systems that solve real problems. College was transformative - I led the Google Developer Student Club (GDSC), where I organized hackathons, gave talks, and worked on small projects to solve problems with software. Most importantly, I found incredible mentors who shaped my approach to both technology and leadership.

During college, I actively sought out internship opportunities at any company that would have me. Each experience, no matter how small, taught me something valuable about the industry and helped me grow as an engineer. The highlight was participating in Google Summer of Code with PostgreSQL, which opened my eyes to the world of open source and large-scale database systems.

This foundation led me to LinkedIn, first as an intern and eventually to my current full-time role. The transition from college projects to handling millions of records in production systems has been both challenging and incredibly rewarding.

## What I Do Today

At LinkedIn, I work on fascinating problems in Hadoop infrastructure:
- Building automated cluster expansion systems that scale seamlessly
- Creating inventory management systems that track complex state transitions across production environments  
- Designing event-driven architectures using Kafka and pub-sub patterns
- Ensuring systems remain reliable while handling massive data workloads

My open source journey continues with contributions to projects like PostgreSQL and OpenWISP, keeping me connected to the broader engineering community.

## Beyond Code

When I'm not debugging distributed systems, you'll find me:
- **On the field**: Playing football (my favorite sport) or the occasional badminton match
- **On the road**: Exploring places on my motorcycle with friends - recently rode to Coonoor, Kotagiri, and Yercaud. Some of my most memorable adventures include longer trips to Sissu and Tosh in the past
- **Getting active**: Recently trying to get into running (still working on building that habit!)
- **Deep in papers**: Reading research papers to understand the theoretical foundations behind the systems I build
- **Writing**: Sharing experiences and learnings to help other engineers navigate similar challenges

## My Philosophy

I believe in learning through building and teaching. Every system I work on teaches me something new, and every research paper I read opens up new possibilities. My time leading GDSC taught me that the best way to grow is by helping others grow too.

I'm convinced that the most robust solutions come from understanding both the theoretical foundations and the practical constraints. Whether it's designing a distributed system or mentoring a junior engineer, I try to balance complexity with simplicity.

## What's Next

While I'm deeply rooted in distributed systems and infrastructure, I'm excited about exploring AI/ML next. The intersection of large-scale data processing and machine learning presents fascinating challenges that I'm eager to dive into.

## Why This Space

I created this site to document my learning journey and share insights from working with distributed systems at scale. From my early days figuring out internships to now handling production systems at LinkedIn, I've learned that sharing knowledge makes all of us better engineers.

Whether you're here for the technical blog posts, the research paper deep dives, or just curious about the journey, I hope you find something useful for your own path in software engineering. -->

<h2 id="my-journey">My Journey</h2>
<p>My journey into software engineering began at <strong>Thapar Institute of Engineering &amp; Technology</strong>, where I specialized in <strong>Cyber-Security and Networking</strong>. During college, I led the <strong>Google Developer Student Club (GDSC)</strong>, managing a 1500+ member community and building internal tooling projects with automated CI/CD pipelines.</p>
<p>A pivotal moment in my career was my time as a <strong>Google Summer of Code Scholar</strong> with <strong>PostgreSQL</strong>. Working on a major open-source database system opened my eyes to the world of distributed data and high-performance backend architecture. This foundation led me to LinkedIn—first as an intern and eventually to my current full-time role as a <strong>Software Engineer</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-build-today">What I Build Today</h2>
<p>At LinkedIn, I solve high-scale infrastructure problems by building software-defined automation:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Distributed Orchestration</strong>: I architected the <strong>Worker RTF</strong> system using <strong>Temporal and gRPC</strong>, creating a distributed state machine to manage node lifecycles and recover <strong>~$14M in underutilized hardware</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Capacity Schedulers</strong>: I engineered the <strong>YARN Forecast-to-Delivery (F2D)</strong> scheduler, automating the delivery of 1,500+ host expansions to power mission-critical features like LinkedIn&rsquo;s Job Recommendations.</li>
<li><strong>Health Microservices</strong>: I developed a zone-aware <strong>Worker Health Validation Service</strong> using Python and Prometheus to prevent faulty node promotions in massive clusters.</li>
<li><strong>Platform Modernization</strong>: I lead core reliability upgrades, migrating internal platforms to <strong>Flask 3.x and SQLAlchemy 2.x</strong> to ensure atomic data writes and long-term service resilience.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="my-philosophy">My Philosophy</h2>
<p>I believe the most robust solutions come from understanding both the <strong>theoretical foundations</strong> and the <strong>practical constraints</strong> of scale. Whether it is resolving distributed race conditions in node assignment or mentoring junior engineers, I try to balance system complexity with operational simplicity. I am convinced that the best way to grow as an engineer is to get your hands dirty with real-world problems at scale while staying grounded in computer science fundamentals.</p>
<h2 id="beyond-code">Beyond Code</h2>
<p>When I&rsquo;m not debugging distributed systems, you&rsquo;ll find me:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>On the field</strong>: Playing football or badminton.</li>
<li><strong>On the road</strong>: Exploring the mountains on my motorcycle—with recent rides to Coonoor, Yercaud, and the Spiti Valley.</li>
<li><strong>Deep in papers</strong>: Reading research on <strong>Consensus Protocols (Raft/Paxos)</strong> and high-performance storage internals.</li>
<li><strong>In the AI Lab</strong>: Currently building <strong>Agentic Workflows</strong> with <strong>LangGraph</strong> to explore the future of self-healing infrastructure.</li>
</ul>

<p>I created this space to share my journey—from my early days in open source to managing one of the world&rsquo;s largest Hadoop deployments. I hope my technical deep-dives and paper reviews help you on your own engineering path.</p>
